# error-handling

The ErrorHandling contract demonstrates different error handling mechanisms in Solidity, including `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. It showcases how these mechanisms can be used to handle various exceptional conditions during contract execution.

## Overview

The ErrorHandling contract provides functionalities for managing ownership, handling insufficient balance during withdrawals, and enforcing constraints on total values.

## Contract Functions

### Ownership Management

The contract allows for the transfer of ownership to a new address. Only the current owner can change the owner address.

- **Function**: `setOwner(address _newOwner)`
  - **Description**: Changes the contract owner to a new address.
  - **Access**: Public
  - **Modifier**: Requires that the caller must be the current owner.

### Insufficient Balance Handling

The contract checks for sufficient balance before allowing withdrawals. If the balance is insufficient, it reverts the transaction with details of the balance and the withdrawal amount.

- **Function**: `withdraw(uint _withdrawAmount)`
  - **Description**: Allows withdrawing funds from the contract balance.
  - **Access**: Public
  - **Modifier**: View
  - **Error Handling**: Uses the `revert` mechanism to handle insufficient balance situations.

### Value Constraint Enforcement

The contract enforces constraints on the total value being added, ensuring it remains within a specified range.

- **Function**: `addValue(uint256 _value)`
  - **Description**: Adds a value to the total and enforces constraints on the total value.
  - **Access**: Public
  - **Error Handling**: Uses the `assert` mechanism to enforce constraints on the total value.

## Error Handling Mechanisms

- **`require`**: Used to enforce conditions before executing a function.
- **`revert`**: Used to revert the transaction if certain conditions are not met, with the option to provide custom error messages and data.
- **`assert`**: Used to check for conditions that should never be false, typically to ensure the correctness of the contract's internal state.
